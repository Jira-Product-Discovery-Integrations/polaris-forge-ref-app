### Jira Product Discovery (JPD) Push Data Via API Reference Application Readme

We are providing ability to send data to JPD via Atlassian Graphql API.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

2. Create Atlassian 3LO app: [link](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/create-3lo-app/)
3. Once the app is created go to `Permissions` tab and click `Add` on `Jira platform REST API` option. Then click `Configure` and enable those scopes: `View user profiles`, `View Jira issue data`, `Create and manage issues`.
4. Next go to `Authorization` tab and set `Callback URL` to `http://localhost:7777`
5. Open `Settings` tab and scroll to `Authentication details` panel at the bottom.
6. Run command to start 3LO ref app:

```bash
npm run push:example -- --issue-url https://pi-dev-sandbox.atlassian.net/browse/AT5-4 --atlassian-app-client-id <APP_CLIENT_ID> --atlassian-app-client-secret <APP_CLIENT_SECRET> --user-message "New message from developer"
```

With the following values:

- `--issue-url` direct issue link to which you has access
